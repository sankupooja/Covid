I have created a visualization with the Covid data I have explored using the SQL .
The tables generated using sql were saved in excel after handling some missing values and removing NULL values.
The tables will also be uploaded according the sheets in the Tableau dashboard .

Here is the link for the tableau dashboard: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sai.pooja.sanku/viz/CovidDataAnlysis/Dashboard1#1
