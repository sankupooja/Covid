I have taken the covid dataset from on online , divided it into covid deaths and covid vaccinations and saved them in excel .

The two excel books were used and imported into the SSMS for working with the data in the database using SQL queries. 

In SSMS, I have written multiple queries to retrieve , understand and analyse the data I have got and what can i make out of it .

From those queries , I have taken only 4 of them to make the visualizations on Tableau. 

I tried to answer some of the crucial problem statements after my analysis :

1. What were the global number of cases, deaths and death percentage ?
2. Can you divide the deaths per continent ?
3. In each country , how many people were infected by COVID?
4. By time series analysis , can I know the important countries with thier average amount of infected poeple with a forecast ?

These problem statements were answered , using the visualizations shown in the tableau with a better undestanding.
Though the data is vast and still some areas were left unexplored and analysed .

Thank you.
